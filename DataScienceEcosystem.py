# - List commonly used data science tools

# Some of the popular languages that Data Scientists use are:
# 1. R Language
# 2. Python
# 3. Scala
# 4. Julia
# 5. SQL

# Some of the commonly used libraries used by Data Scientists include:
# 1. NumPy
# 2. Pandas
# 3. SciPy
# 4. Keras
# 5. Matplotlib

# | Data Science Tools |

# ### Below are a few examples of evaluating arithmetic expressions in Python
# 

# In[1]:


#This a simple arithmetic expression to mutiply then add integers
(3*4)+5


# In[2]:


#This will convert 200 minutes to hours by diving by 60
200/60
